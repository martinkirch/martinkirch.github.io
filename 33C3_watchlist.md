# A watchlist from the 33C3

Last December the [Chaos Computer Club](http://ccc.de/)
held the [33rd Chaos Communication Congress (33C3)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page).
It is a rare occasion to hear about cryptography, ergonomics, protocols, 
architecture, politics, and many more, in a single event. 

All recordings are [available online](https://media.ccc.de/c/33c3) and 
accessible to non-specialists. 
Of course I did not have time to watch everything, but could catch a dozen... 
and here are my favorites.


[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? ](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7964-where_in_the_world_is_carmen_sandiego)

A talk about travel booking systems and the burden of their history. 
I'm told the presentation do not discuss enough the role of international regulation or 
bookers' countermeasures, but it would put the fun out of it.


[Recount 2016: An Uninvited Security Audit of the U.S. Presidential Election](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8074-recount_2016_an_uninvited_security_audit_of_the_u_s_presidential_election)

A saga around the latest American election and a useful reminder that voting 
machines are far from saving democracies.


Many thanks to the speakers and organizers for sharing this !
